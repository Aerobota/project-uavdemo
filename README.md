# UAV Demo

This project is a demonstration of OSH capabilities for tasking a UAV platform and collecting/processing UAV data including navigation and imagery. It also shows how the drone data can be effectively combined with other sources of data such as:

- Other video camera (with or without PTZ tasking)
- Mobile phone sensors
- Arduino based sensors

The following diagram illustrates the demo setup:
